# self-portrait-boxes

A Clojure library designed to recreate a [Processing](http://processing.org/) sketch (amazingly titled: [vid_may11b.pde](https://github.com/phiat/self-portrait-boxes/blob/master/resources/vid_may11b.pde)) I made a while back. 

Uses [quil](https://github.com/quil/quil)

**currently stuck on how to bring the processing video library into clojure.  probably need the jar?**

update:  trying to incorporate [processing video libraries](https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/master/java/libraries/video) to work with quil.

## Usage

in the works.   currently exploring processing.video integration.

```clojure

```
